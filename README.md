# LoggerMiddleware
Logging middleware for Django.

The logs created have the following format ip:base64(request)
This middleware creates an additional view so be careful where you put it.
A working path is.
<project_name>/<project_main_folder>/<additional_folder>/
Contact me if you encounter any troubles.
Cheers
